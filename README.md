## Introduction

WeChat mini-programs are "sub-applications" within the Tencent WeChat ecosystem. Different from iOS and Android apps that need to be downloaded and installed, such mini-programs are light. They can provide native apps' user experience and are more manageable. Mini programs can use powerful WeChat APIs to implement online payments, position, face recognition, and so on. Using WeChat mini program development tools and WeChat APIs, applications can be achieved and deployed efficiently.
